It is about a development in C# with .net 6 of a web api to do integrations hotels 

### Architecture and technologies used
* **Windows 10**
* **Net core 6**
* Nginx Web server
* Visual studio 2022 community Edition
* Nunit
* Newtonsoft.Json

### Points completed
* **Code in english with so love and not so bad style of code (I think)**
* Main allows the passing of parameters. Url, name of file json and path to download

### Points not completed:
* **Deserialization of json hosted on local web server (Nginx)**
* **Code with the best style of code (I think)**
* Data entry form, available when there are no parameters

So **many thanks to the people** who have given me the exercise, **to prove myself**
